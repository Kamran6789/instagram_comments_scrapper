# ðŸ“² Instagram Comment Scraper using Playwright & MySQL

This project automates the process of logging into Instagram, navigating to specific profiles or posts, scraping all available comments, and storing them in a MySQL database. Built with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for browser automation and [MySQL Connector](https://pypi.org/project/mysql-connector-python/) for database operations, it is designed to simulate human behavior and avoid detection by Instagram's anti-bot mechanisms.
